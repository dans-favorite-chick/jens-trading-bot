# Phoenix Bot — Current State

_Last updated: 2026-04-25 EOD Central Daylight Time_
_Next Claude session: read this FIRST for situational awareness_

## Bot operational state (as of Saturday 2026-04-25 EOD)

- **Prod bot:** UP, flat, Sim101 account (LIVE_TRADING=False). PID and uptime
  re-stabilized after the 14:31 CDT reboot (TeamViewer-initiated).
- **Sim bot:** UP, Phase C live-sim execution on 16 dedicated NT8 Sim
  accounts. 24/7 trading, per-strategy risk isolation, real OIF writes,
  10 strategies loaded.
- **Lab bot:** **DECOMMISSIONED** — paper-only flow ended 2026-04-21.
  `bots/lab_bot.py` preserved on disk as rollback safety net only.
- **Bridge:** UP on :8765 (NT8) + :8766 (bots) + :8767 (health)
- **Dashboard:** UP on :5000, with per-strategy risk panel, Grades tab,
  Logs tab, and (new today) sentiment-flow surface.
- **Watchdog:** UP, tracks prod + sim
- **NT8:** live, MNQM6, single client confirmed (multi-stream issue
  resolved per Sunday 2026-04-19 diagnostic).

## Today's sprint summary (2026-04-25)

A two-phase Saturday rebuild day. **All work shipped to `origin/main` at
commit `c2dcdc8`.** Defaults remain SAFE (`PHOENIX_RISK_GATE=0`,
`PHOENIX_STREAM_VALIDATOR=0`, `SENTIMENT_FLOW_ACTIVE=false`).

### Phase B+ skeleton sprint (morning)

Six items shipped behind off-by-default flags:

1. **NT8 stream validator** — `core/bridge/stream_validator.py` +
   `tools/nt8_stream_quarantine.py`. Price-band / peer-MAD / tick-grid
   checks. Gated by `PHOENIX_STREAM_VALIDATOR=1`.
2. **Fail-closed risk gate** — `core/risk/risk_gate.py` +
   `tools/risk_gate_runner.py` + `tools/watchdog_runner.py`. Named-pipe
   gate (`\\.\pipe\phoenix_risk_gate`), OIFSink shim, atomic OIF writer,
   heartbeat watchdog. Gated by `PHOENIX_RISK_GATE=1`.
3. **FinBERT sentiment skeleton** — `core/sentiment_finbert.py` +
   `agents/sentiment_flow_agent.py`. **Real INT8 ONNX model now installed
   under `models/finbert_onnx_int8/`** (downloaded via optimum-cli;
   gitignored). Council voter wired at `DEFAULT_WEIGHT = 0.0`.
4. **Chicago VPS migration plan** — `docs/chicago_vps_migration_plan.md`
   + `tools/verify_jsonl_continuity.py`. **STRICKEN per Jennifer
   2026-04-25** — Phoenix stays on the Trading PC. Doc preserved for
   reference; no infra moves planned.
5. **SKILLS auto-digest** — `tools/skills_digest.py` generates
   `SKILLS.md` and is wired into the SessionStart hook.
6. **Dashboard Grades + Logs tabs** — surface `tools/grade_open_predictions.py`
   output directly in the Flask dashboard.

### Phase B+ "remaining §3" sprint (afternoon → evening)

After greenlight on §2.2 / §2.3 / §3.5 / §3.6 / §4.1 / §4.3 / §4.4:

1. **§2.2 FRED macros** — real `core/fred_client.py` with regime-shift
   detection on FFR / CPI / UNRATE / T10Y2Y; cached at
   `data/cache/fred/`.
2. **§2.3 Finnhub real client** — REST + WebSocket dual-path with token
   bucket; key already present in `.env`.
3. **§3.1 TradingView webhook** — **STRICKEN** (Premium $59.95/mo not
   worth the cost). HMAC-SHA256 webhook scaffolding removed from active
   roadmap; placeholder code retained but not imported anywhere.
4. **§3.4 Phoenix-specific skills** — **DEFERRED**. `.claude/skills/`
   directory created (empty), allowlisted in `.gitignore`, future-ready.
5. **§3.5 OIF kill-switch** — `tools/oif_kill_switch.py`. One-command
   manual halt: writes `outgoing/halt_all.json`, prod_bot watches for
   it on every cycle, refuses new entries until cleared.
6. **§3.6 Phoenix Routines** — three deterministic routines:
   - `tools/routines/morning_ritual.py` (06:30 CT, Mon-Fri)
   - `tools/routines/post_session_debrief.py` (16:05 CT, Mon-Fri,
     chains PhoenixGrading at 16:00)
   - `tools/routines/weekly_evolution.py` (Sun 18:00 CT)
   - Shared `tools/routines/_shared.py` with: `RoutineReport`
     (verdict-deterministic), `DigestQueue` (file-backed FIFO at
     `out/digest_queue.jsonl`), AI wrappers (`call_claude` /
     `call_gemini` fail-soft), Telegram dispatch
     (`send_telegram_now` for RED, `send_consolidated_digest` for
     EOD), PDF assembly via reportlab, `stack_health_snapshot()`.
   - **Three Jennifer amendments locked in:**
     - Verdict is computed from deterministic checks ONLY; AI commentary
       is appendix and CANNOT influence GREEN/AMBER/RED.
     - Every weekly_evolution commit body MUST include CPCV / DSR / PBO
       checkboxes with status "NOT YET RUN (Phase C dependency)".
     - All routine output is queued to `out/digest_queue.jsonl` and
       drained as ONE consolidated Telegram at 16:05 (only RED-verdict
       items fire an immediate interrupting Telegram).
7. **§4.1 / 4.3 / 4.4 Strategy fixes (A-F)** — locked-in regression
   tests committed at `tests/test_lock_in_epic_v1/` (20 new tests):
   - ORB ATR-adaptive stops
   - bias_momentum SHORT mirror + VCR=1.2 threshold
   - noise_area silent cadence + band_mult=0.7
   - ib_breakout 10-minute window
   - compression min_squeeze_bars=12
   - spring_setup retired

### Tooling, infra, plugins

- **Plugins installed:** machine-learning-ops, incident-response,
  pyright-lsp, document-skills, example-skills (via `claude plugin
  install` CLI subcommand). Total: **10 plugins / 72 skills indexed**.
- **`.gitignore` hardened:** broad ignores for venv/.venv-ml/models/
  out/.claude/ etc. with allowlist patterns for
  `phoenix_bot/orchestrator/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/skills/`,
  `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/settings.json`, `out/baselines/`. Re-ignore
  patterns to stop bytecode caches sneaking in via greedy `**` allowlists.
- **GitHub auth fixed** — Statechamp76 → dans-favorite-chick mapping
  via `gh auth logout` + `gh auth login`. Push to `origin/main`
  succeeded at commit `c2dcdc8`.

## Test count

- **Before today:** 989 (Friday EOD 2026-04-24)
- **After Phase B+ skeleton sprint:** 1,081
- **After Routines + remaining §3 sprint:** **1,221 passing / 0 failing**

## Scheduled task state (2026-04-25 EOD)

After the 14:31 reboot, currently registered:

| Task | Schedule | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `PhoenixLearner` | 23:30 CT daily | ✅ REGISTERED (survived reboot) |
| `PhoenixGrading` | 16:00 CT Mon-Fri | ⏳ Script ready: `scripts/register_phoenix_grading_task.ps1` |
| `PhoenixRiskGate` | on-boot | ⏳ Script ready: `scripts/register_risk_gate_task.ps1` |
| `PhoenixMorningRitual` | 06:30 CT Mon-Fri | ⏳ Script ready: `scripts/register_morning_ritual_task.ps1` |
| `PhoenixPostSessionDebrief` | 16:05 CT Mon-Fri | ⏳ Script ready: `scripts/register_post_session_debrief_task.ps1` |
| `PhoenixWeeklyEvolution` | Sun 18:00 CT | ⏳ Script ready: `scripts/register_weekly_evolution_task.ps1` |

**ACTION:** Re-run the four `register_*.ps1` scripts as Administrator
to restore the full schedule. Each script is idempotent (replaces any
existing task of the same name). The em-dash / schtasks / python-alias
issues are all fixed in the current versions.

## AI agent live status

- **Gemini (Council, Pre-Trade Filter):** ACTIVE.
- **Claude (Session Debriefer, Historical Learner):** ACTIVE — the
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY issue was resolved 2026-04-21 via commit `eac5ae4`
  (`load_dotenv override=True`). The 108-char key has been verified
  end-to-end.

## Account state

- **Real live account balance:** $300 (small_account_mode active)
- **Live trading status:** PAUSED — prod stays Sim101 until account
  reaches $2,000.
- **Sim bot:** $2,000 × 16 strategies = $32,000 virtual pool.

## Ground rules locked in this weekend

- Phoenix stays on the Trading PC. No VPS migration.
- TradingView Premium not approved. Stricken from roadmap.
- Per-strategy risk isolation is the unit of accounting.
- AI is **advisory only** — every routine verdict is deterministic.
- Telegram is the ONLY runtime alert channel (Twilio SMS is escalation
  only, behind WatcherAgent).

## Repository state

- Branch: `main`
- HEAD: `c2dcdc8` (chore(gitignore): re-ignore __pycache__ in
  allowlisted dirs; drop stale .pyc; add phoenix_bot/__init__.py)
- Working tree: **clean**
- Pushed to `origin/main`: ✅
- 10 plugins installed via `claude plugin install`
- 72 skills indexed via `tools/skills_digest.py` → `SKILLS.md`

## Immediate to-dos for the next session

1. Re-run all five `register_*.ps1` scripts as Administrator to restore
   the scheduled task lattice after the 14:31 reboot.
2. Verify `PhoenixMorningRitual` fires Monday 2026-04-27 at 06:30 CT —
   look for `out/morning_ritual/2026-04-27.md` + a non-RED verdict.
3. Verify `PhoenixPostSessionDebrief` consolidated digest arrives on
   Telegram Monday 16:05 CT containing the morning_ritual snippet.
4. First floor-kill test still pending — manually trigger a strategy
   to -$500 cumulative to validate halt + persistence + Telegram alert
   path.
5. CPCV / DSR / PBO validation harness implementation when Phase C
   data depth allows (currently the weekly_evolution checkboxes read
   "NOT YET RUN").
